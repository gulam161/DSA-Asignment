Problem 1: Majority Element

Instructions: Given an array of integers, find the majority element, i.e., the element that appears more than n/2 times (where n is the size of the array). If no majority element exists, return -1.

Example Test Case:

Input: [2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Output: 5

Problem 2: Find All Duplicates in an Array

Instructions: Given an array of integers, find all the elements that appear twice in the array and return them.

Example Test Case:

Input: [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]

Output: [2, 3]

# 2D Array Assignment

Problem 3: print the sum of all elements in a row

Instruction: Write a function called sumOfRows that takes in three parameters: N, M, and arr. The parameters N and M represent the number of rows and columns in a 2D array respectively, while arr is the 2D array itself. The function should calculate and print the sum of each row in the 2D array, with each sum printed on a new line.

Example Test Case:

Input: let arr = [
[1, 2],
[3, 4],
[5, 6]
];

Output: 3 7 11

Problem 4: print the elements of the 2D array, row by row

Instruction: Given a 2D array arr with N rows and M columns, write a program to print the elements of the array row by row. The input array is represented by the variable arr, which contains N rows and M columns. Your task is to iterate through the array and print each element, row by row.

Example Test Case:

Input: let arr = [
[1, 2],
[3, 4],
[5, 6]
];

Output:
1 2
3 4
5 6

Problem 5: print the sum of indexes of the 2D array

Instruction: Given a 2D array arr with N rows and M columns, write a program to calculate the sum of the indexes for each position in the array.

Example Test Case:

Input: arr = [
[1, 2],
[3, 4],
[5, 6]
]

Output: indexSum = [
[0, 1],
[1, 1],
[2, 1]
]

Problem 6: print the sum of even elements present in the row

Instruction: Given a 2D array arr with N rows and M columns, write a program to calculate the sum of even elements present in each row.

Example Test Case:

Input: arr = [
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
]

Output:
2
10
8

Problem 7: print the sum of odd elements present in the row

Instruction:Given a 2D array arr with N rows and M columns, write a program to calculate the sum of odd elements present in each row.

Example Test Case:

Input: arr = [
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
]

Output:
4
5
16

Problem 8: print [Yes], if any particular row of a 2D array contains at least one vowel, at least print [No]

Instruction: Given 2D array is stored in a variable with the name arr, and contains lower case English characters- You have to print [Yes], if any particular row of a 2D array contains at least one vowel, at least print [No]:-

Example Test Case:

Input: arr = [
['a', 'b'],
['c', 'd'],
['e', 'f'],
]

Output:
[Yes]
[No]
[Yes]

Problem 9: print the sum of even elements present in the column.

Instruction: Given a 2D array arr with N rows and M columns, write a program to calculate the sum of even elements present in each column.

Example Test Case:

Input: arr = [
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
]

Output:
4
10
6

Problem 10: print the sum of odd elements present in the column

Instruction: Given a 2D array arr with N rows and M columns, write a program to calculate the sum of odd elements present in each column.

Example Test Case:

Input: arr = [
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9],
];

Output:
8
5
12

Problem 11: print elements of array as shown in the diagram, on a single line.

Instruction: Given a 2D array matrix, write a program to print the elements of the array as shown in the diagram, on a single line.

Example Test Case:

Input: matrix = [
[1, 8, 9],
[2, 7, 10],
[3, 6, 11],
[4, 5, 12],
]

Output: 4 3 2 1 5 6 7 12 11 10 9

Problem 12: print elements of array on a single line.

Instruction: Given a 2D array matrix, write a program to print the elements of the array in a specific pattern, on a single line.

Example Test Case:

Input: matrix = [
[1, 8, 9],
[2, 7, 10],
[3, 6, 11],
[4, 5, 12],
]

Output:
9 10 11 12 8 7 6 5 1 2 3 4

Problem 13: Print the matrix elements starting from the top right corner and follow a zig-zag pattern.

Instruction: Given a 2D array matrix, write a program to print the elements of the array starting from the top right corner and following a zig-zag pattern.

Example Test Case:

Input: matrix = [
[4, 7, 1, 1, 7],
[8, 9, 9, 6, 1],
[6, 4, 9, 5, 1],
[7, 7, 4, 7, 7],
[8, 6, 2, 5, 5]
]

Output: 7 1 1 7 4 8 9 9 6 1 1 5 9 4 6 7 7 4 7 7 5 5 2 6 8
